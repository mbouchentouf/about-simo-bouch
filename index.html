                    Simo works best in the central time zone. He recently fled mountain time zone because he
                    doesn't want bootcamp to start at 8am.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simo is a United Airlines frequently flyer. This flyer status allows him access to the most luxurious
                    lounges at the Houston Airport. Please see the attached photo of Simo's comfortable workspace.
